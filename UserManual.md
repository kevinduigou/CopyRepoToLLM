# üìò Desktop Context Copier ‚Äî User Manual

**Purpose:** This tool helps you craft effective, high-quality context for LLM-assisted coding by allowing you to curate, structure, and export codebase information (files, snippets, and rules) to your clipboard. Paste this context into any LLM interface (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor) to improve response relevance and coding performance.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Effective Context Creation

### 1. **Comprehensive Codebase Representation**

- ‚úÖ **Include File Structure**  
  Keep "Include Tree Context" checked to provide the LLM with a visual summary of your directory hierarchy.

- ‚úÖ **Drag Critical Files**  
  Add core classes, modules, or config files relevant to your task. This allows the LLM to reason with the actual logic in your system.

- ‚úÖ **Select Key Snippets**  
  Use the preview pane to extract and include only the essential methods or blocks when full files are too large or noisy.

---

### 2. **Clear Instructions and Goals**

- ‚úÖ **Fill in the "Describe your need..." box**  
  Write a clear task description. Specify the desired output, format, or coding constraints.

- ‚úÖ **Break down complex tasks**  
  For multifaceted requests, explain them step-by-step in the user input. Example:
  > "First, create a function to parse the YAML config. Then integrate it into the CLI entry point."

---

### 3. **Use Rules for Focused Guidance**

- ‚úÖ **Check Applicable Rules**  
  Include coding conventions, formatting preferences, or project-specific rules to guide LLM behavior.

- ‚öôÔ∏è Click the gear icon ‚Üí "Edit Rules" to add or update your rules.

## üí° Tips & Tricks

- üîç **Regex file filter**: Use the input above the tree to filter visible files. Try `.*\.py$` to show only Python files.
- üñ±Ô∏è **Right-click power**: Right-click on tree items, file preview, or buffer items for advanced actions.
- üìé **Context is copied in plain text**: You can paste it directly into any chat with an LLM, or save it to a file for later use.
- üß† **LLM prompt hint**: Begin your prompt like this for better results:  
  > "Here's my code context for reference. Please help me [describe task]..."

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Problem                                | Solution                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File preview not showing?              | Ensure it's a text-based file under the selected root directory.         |
| Rules not showing up?                  | Use the gear icon ‚Üí Edit Rules ‚Üí Save at least one rule.                 |
